  "description": "Spire with Friends is a multiplayer mod for Slay the Spire, which includes both a Coop and Versus mode.\n\nFeatures:\n• Full Steam-powered connectivity\n•Plug and Play\n•Up to 6 player in Coop\n• Up to 200 Players in the speedrunning style Versus mode.\n• A matchmaking and lobby system.\n\nSupport of this mod is ongoing, however the current state is close to the final intended product. If you\u0027d like to support this mod, or report bugs, please visit the following links:\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/chronometrics\n\nMy Personal Discord Server: https://discord.gg/DMTbntH\nGithub Bug Report Page: https://github.com/Tempus/Slay-the-Spire-Together/issues/new\n\n\nF.A.Q.\n\nWhen did development of this mod begin?\n\n- A proof of concept for this mod was created on Oct 27, 2019. I decided to do a complete mod during the Christmas holidays of Dec 2020.\n\n\nWill you be merging with the other multiplayer mod?\n\nNo, the design direction of these two mods is very different. I set out from the beginning to deliberately not include simultaneous combat and will likely continue to do so.\n\n\nWill you add x feature?\n\nSome improvements are in the road map, if you\u0027d like to chat about it please join the Discord, if you\u0027d like to champion specific features check out my Patreon.\n\n\nWill this work with other mods?\n\nCurrently, yes and no. It should work seamlessly with any non-content mods. It should also work with most content mods as long as all players are using the same ones. Character mods will work as well, but do not work in the current release due to out-of-scope UI features.\n\n\nWill you be translating this into my language?\n\nI would like to support other languages, consider contacting me on Discord if you want to provide a translation.",
