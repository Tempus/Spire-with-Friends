Funnel description is wrong after pickup
Vapor funnel not correctly assessing penalties/bonuses

There should be a message when lives swap for keys
Vapour funnel doesn't account for the potion bonus at the beginning of the game, only the penalty
We could improve the display of keys in the messaging systems when a friend gives one to you
Patreons and Credits need to be updated, including translations
Private lobbies might not work
Mirror Touch and Wallet sync bugs should be fixed perhaps
Fix some visual booster bugs you fucktard, also String of Fate resolution issues

Disconnections suck
Better handling of disconnections or force-skip on the voting screens, need to clear names
Orrery still showing up in Dimensioneel

parasite don't lose max hp for mirror touch
Retry does some really weird shit when custom modifiers are on - Draft and Flight messed up

FYI, If you use Bonds of Fate to bypass a Ruby Key, the rest site in Act 4 still offers you the Ruby Key as an option. 
Rules checkmarks in the lobby don't always reflect

Retry bonuses shouldn't show up on top floor
On Versus when you retry, it should push Floor Change to 0, to prevent a visual bug where you are max hp but the first floor hasn't been clicked yet.

Shouldn't be possible to be 0 couriers in an act

Just saw a fun bug:  Boss swapped into pandora's box, and took the downside: add a defend.  It looks like the defend got lost?!  It didn't get replaced or added to the deck.

Trading bottles when you have multiple bottles is a little weird



Co-op Relic ideas:

	Hunting Knives
		For each teammate who has started a combat with an enemy before you, that enemies loses 5% HP at the start of battle.

	Something that increases the floor density?

	Click and drag to swap/rearrange map nodes, once per act per person.

	-> Relic Dolly Mirror

	A "skip events and permascale a card" relic?
	A campfire choice relic?
	Block bag shared block?
	• Dimensioneel option -> Reroll all non-boss relics, BUT you get to choose your set as a team (by clicking on a relic in the screen to select it in your colour, with the selection being exclusive). This sounds strong but also people are very loss averse so maybe it feels terrible?

	-> Increases the number of nodes next Act. Possible new relic instead? Architect Kit?
	Relic where people sacrifice permanent str or dex to give others str or dex (reallocating it basically)


To-Do:

• Improve mod detection so it doesn't misdetect so often
• Backup portraits for when Steam fails

• Do some profiling and see if there are issues you can smooth out performance-wise.

• In versus the retry gives different card rewards?
• In Versus, after dying, got Lament only but no Neow bonus

• receive a relic from courier, then send the same relic, it sends your new one not the old one. Real sad.


(Improve the death screen stack)
• Splits on death screen hover
• Boss relic skip doesn't work.

• Custom/Modded character relic upgrade crashes (Neow Bonuses)
• Custom character class specific relic is no good either
• Consider making Orrery/Cauldron work right with Courier

• Honk button


Won't do yet:

• Make the player map drawing controls not have clickthrough and block click/hits.

• Extra coop relics x1
• Versus improvements for speedrunners - solo speedrun, storing splits, PBs, seed comparisons for unseeded
• default profile picture for individuals in place of steam, spire with friends logo? The holdy hands friends?
• Finish Coop non-stacking vanilla relics
• Change Preserved Insect, Boot, Prayer Wheel descriptions to reflect stacking copies...?

• Ultrawide monitors have big issues on layout for map and courier
• Courier drops items when you leave the reward window, but should clear the rewards when you leave the Courier room instead
• Can send bottles or bottled cards with courier - these interactions surely work poorly.... or do they?

• Custom mode menu's y value needs to be setting scaled

• Dimensional wallet doesn't always sync money correctly
• I cant proceed after taking Big House
• Blue Ladder uses up wing boots charges T_T

• Floor related things such as relic availability or Mind Bloom or Portal to Boss probably don't work right anymore.
• Brush size Persist between runs as a feature

• Why not add some pre-drawn 'stamps' that can be added to the map via drawing?

• Neow will cause a crash if the number of players drops between having the options presented and selecting them.

• If players are too fast, they can both choose the same Neow options, causing a softlock

• Players can choose their own configurable colour (Out of Scope)

• Add a map trail toggle so that other player's map trail aren't obnoxious
• Improvements to RAINBOW title fire
• Event panels draw overtop of team stats

• Top Panel timer shifts positions, which is a little awkward
• Indication of the number of deaths on the player widget (Versus)

• bug report: i abandoned a match in spire with friends and then switched profiles and my game crashed
• Start a run with modifiers that have a specific team relic


Out of scope:

• Tiny House and Calling Bell ruin the team relic select screen if you click too fast
• The game softlocks if you open the team relic chest before getting a curse from a bell.
• Floor 50+ retry bonus might fail if basemod merge daily mods setting is turned off

• Run History doesn't show team relics
• There are lag issues with Mirror Touch and probably other shared relics (eg. one player gets hurt while the other loses max hp), can fix this by doing the differential instead of absolute value
• Random button for character select

• Coop Boss Choice - players get to choose their boss, earlier players choose first. Might be nice, since you could adjust at courier for who to fight who.

• Neow choices are bad for the last player, no indication you are sharing choices, no indication of what the others picked
• Smoke bomb should leave the enemy and the health
