More Features to add:

	Chat, Hard Mode, Infusions, Merge Cards, Bingo, Steam Portraits, Old Fixes, Downfall

	Chat
		Make a chatting icon instead of the silly text prompt when in 'isOpen'
		Line wrap
		Names with spaces in them get colour bugged

	Hard Mode
		Champ is not threatening

	Infusions
		Return this card to your hand shouldn't be valid on a 0 cost card...
		Infused card transfer via Courier

	Merge Cards
		Merge Anger fix (and other cards with similar effects... claw seems to fail as well, maybe others)
		Avox played Liquid Memories on a merge card but the card that drew only played one of the two cards
		Streamline Cell did not become cheaper
		Blunt scissors applies to skill/attack/power pots
		Merge Card pool removal doesn't seem to be working as yet, or possibly not for the second card
		Multiple Energy symbols in the description don't get the second one replaced with an icon because they lack a trailing space and have a trailing '.'

		// Neow Bonus - Merge a Drafted Uncommon
			This needs to *target* a player and store the results until both have chosen

	Bingo
		Bingo board should render over card reward (and maybe other things)
		Victory screen doesn't convey sufficient victory
		Draw line across winning bingo
		Things like 'visit 15 events' should have a counter

		Cycleable bingo team size should update when more players join

	Fix steam portraits so they are never null
		- If they are null they will cause a crash with bingo!!!

	Fix Mirror Touch tooltip so it stops recalculating
	Versus bug fixes?
	Change blue ladder... again

	Sometimes the Player Widgets are getting doubled (?!)

	Neow's Text box covers the starting bonuses and shouldn't
	Fix relic list syncs for Watcher/Defect/Boss Relic Swap?
	Prevent Neow simul-clicks

	Downfall has a boss clicking bug where you can't click on the boss (characters only...?)

	Clicking a player widget should pop up their Deck Screen, I suppose!

	Transfered Deck updates for obtain/removals

	Card Infusions gave SpeedFrog infusions and I got Card pool merging

	To Test:
		√ Message in a Bottle when deck screen up softlock fix?
		√ Kick crashing 
		√ Blunt Scissors




Funnel description is wrong after pickup
Vapor funnel not correctly assessing penalties/bonuses

There should be a message when lives swap for keys
Searing blow doesn't reflect its upgrade level in the hover tip
Vapour funnel doesn't account for the potion bonus at the beginning of the game, only the penalty
Message in a bottle goes dark after you pick it
Message in a bottle can still softlock on the deck screen
We could improve the display of keys in the messaging systems when a friend gives one to you
Dimensioneel might be able to send character specific starter relic upgrades... good or bad?
Trading expired relics is sad
Patreons and Credits need to be updated, including translations
If someone disconnects at Key Door you need to let the players move on
Private lobbies might not work
Mirror Touch and Wallet sync bugs should be fixed perhaps
Fix some visual booster bugs you fucktard, also String of Fate resolution issues

Disconnections suck
Better handling of disconnections or force-skip on the voting screens, need to clear names
Orrery still showing up in Dimensioneel

parasite don't lose max hp for mirror touch
Retry does some really weird shit when custom modifiers are on - Draft and Flight messed up

FYI, If you use Bonds of Fate to bypass a Ruby Key, the rest site in Act 4 still offers you the Ruby Key as an option. 

get rid of some extra logs
fix/improve steam profile images
Rules checkmarks in the lobby don't always reflect

Retry bonuses shouldn't show up on top floor
On Versus when you retry, it should push Floor Change to 0, to prevent a visual bug where you are max hp but the first floor hasn't been clicked yet.

Shouldn't be possible to be 0 couriers in an act

Just saw a fun bug:  Boss swapped into pandora's box, and took the downside: add a defend.  It looks like the defend got lost?!  It didn't get replaced or added to the deck.

Trading bottles when you have multiple bottles is a little weird



Co-op Relic ideas:

	Hunting Knives
		For each teammate who has started a combat with an enemy before you, that enemies loses 5% HP at the start of battle.

	Something that increases the floor density?

	Click and drag to swap/rearrange map nodes, once per act per person.

	Dimensioneel replacement??? -> Offer two random relics you can give to other players at the courier (at a higher price?)
								-> Relic Dolly Mirror

	A "skip events and permascale a card" relic?
	A campfire choice relic?
	Block bag shared block?
	• Dimensioneel option -> Reroll all non-boss relics, BUT you get to choose your set as a team (by clicking on a relic in the screen to select it in your colour, with the selection being exclusive). This sounds strong but also people are very loss averse so maybe it feels terrible?

	-> Increases the number of nodes next Act. Possible new relic instead? Architect Kit?
	Relic where people sacrifice permanent str or dex to give others str or dex (reallocating it basically)


To-Do:

• Improve mod detection so it doesn't misdetect so often
• Backup portraits for when Steam fails

• Do some profiling and see if there are issues you can smooth out performance-wise.
• Save and Quit button still sometimes says 'Save and Quit' -> It should never say save and quit

• In versus the retry gives different card rewards?
• In Versus, after dying, got Lament only but no Neow bonus

• Player decks don't update properly with transmutations.
• receive a relic from courier, then send the same relic, it sends your new one not the old one. Real sad.


(Improve the death screen stack)
• Splits on death screen hover
• End of game versus screen should have a scroll bar so you can see everyone's results


• Custom Run History
• Maybe try out the huge health heart and team heart kills?

• the double/extra/lower/hidden encounter should be available to the next player who wants to visit that location, rather than making the next player wait for the previous one

• Boss relic skip doesn't work.

• Custom/Modded character relic upgrade crashes (Neow Bonuses)
• Custom character class specific relic is no good either
• Consider making Orrery/Cauldron work right with Courier

• Honk button
• Full deck screen for other players by clicking on their widget?

Won't do yet:

• Make the player map drawing controls not have clickthrough and block click/hits.

• Extra coop relics x1
• Versus improvements for speedrunners - solo speedrun, storing splits, PBs, seed comparisons for unseeded
• default profile picture for individuals in place of steam, spire with friends logo? The holdy hands friends?
• Finish Coop non-stacking vanilla relics
• Change Preserved Insect, Boot, Prayer Wheel descriptions to reflect stacking copies...?

• Ultrawide monitors have big issues on layout for map and courier
• Courier drops items when you leave the reward window, but should clear the rewards when you leave the Courier room instead
• Can send bottles or bottled cards with courier - these interactions surely work poorly.... or do they?

• Custom mode menu's y value needs to be setting scaled

• Dimensional wallet doesn't always sync money correctly
• I cant proceed after taking Big House
• Blue Ladder uses up wing boots charges T_T

• Floor related things such as relic availability or Mind Bloom or Portal to Boss probably don't work right anymore.
• Brush size Persist between runs as a feature

• Why not add some pre-drawn 'stamps' that can be added to the map via drawing?

• Neow will cause a crash if the number of players drops between having the options presented and selecting them.

• If players are too fast, they can both choose the same Neow options, causing a softlock

• Players can choose their own configurable colour (Out of Scope)

• Add a map trail toggle so that other player's map trail aren't obnoxious
• Improvements to RAINBOW title fire
• Event panels draw overtop of team stats

• Top Panel timer shifts positions, which is a little awkward
• Indication of the number of deaths on the player widget (Versus)

• bug report: i abandoned a match in spire with friends and then switched profiles and my game crashed
• Start a run with modifiers that have a specific team relic


Out of scope:

• Tiny House and Calling Bell ruin the team relic select screen if you click too fast
• The game softlocks if you open the team relic chest before getting a curse from a bell.
• Floor 50+ retry bonus might fail if basemod merge daily mods setting is turned off

• Run History doesn't show team relics
• There are lag issues with Mirror Touch and probably other shared relics (eg. one player gets hurt while the other loses max hp), can fix this by doing the differential instead of absolute value
• Random button for character select

• Coop Boss Choice - players get to choose their boss, earlier players choose first. Might be nice, since you could adjust at courier for who to fight who.

• Neow choices are bad for the last player, no indication you are sharing choices, no indication of what the others picked
• Smoke bomb should leave the enemy and the health
